Towards the first AI inspired Saree Gown, in collaboration with Vogue and Designer Gaurav Gupta
<!--more-->

<img src="/img/portfolio/gg_2.jpg" width="500">

The Cognitive Fashion team collaborated with Vogue and fashion designer Gaurav Gupta for creating a line of designs. The designs would showcase the theme around the native place of the winners of Vogue Women of the Year Awards, 2017. We analyzed images crawled using instagram for each of these regions to mine dominant patterns and colors for each of these native place and shared them with the designer. Designer Gaurav used these as a source of inspiration to design a saree gown which lit up in the colors representative of the winners as they received their award.
