Traditionally, fashion houses send fashion experts to the big four major runway shows who actually observe what is being shown and form a subjective opinion of the emerging mega trends. While there is great value in expert fashion observations, they are invariably limited by how many shows they can see. It is seemingly impossible for one person to manually look towards say 50,000 thousand images coming out from the runway shows. With a more data-driven approach, AI tools can crunch all the images and then provide trend reports to the observers who can now use data based insights to back up their gut instincts.

On the heels of New York Fashion Week, the IBM Research Cognitive Fashion team analyzed runway images from 12 different designers, to uncover insights such as dominant color trends, repeating patterns, and similarities (cut, color and knee length) between classic and up-and-coming designers and offer the data and insights exclusively to Women's Wear Daily (WWD). WWD is considered the bible of the fashion industry. Based on the insights provided an exclusive article appeared in WWD on March 14, 2017.
