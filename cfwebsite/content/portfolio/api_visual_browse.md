Show me more like this
<!--more-->

For any given image in the product catalog find other similar images in the product catalog purely based on visual appearance.

<img src="/img/portfolio/visual_browse_1.jpg" width="600">

A user clicks on an existing apparel/accessory image in the catalog and Visual Browse will fetch and display similar looking products from the catalog. Visual Browse does not need any meta information and search is based only on images. The deep learning based CNN model has been fine tuned to the domain of fashion.

## Use cases

1. Automatically enable `other similar looks` feature on the website.
1. Useful to recommend alternate items when an item goes out of stock.
1. This is a more interactive way of browsing the catalog based on visual search. It essentially recreates the experience of asking `Show me more dresses like this.` 
1. Encourages serendipitous buying and sticky behavior on the website.
