On November 3, 2016 at Vogue China's 11th anniversary event, the most influential fashion gala in China, over 2000 leading industry figures in fashion, art and media witnessed the debut of China's first cognitive dress powered by assets from the IBM Research cognitive fashion project. The cognitive dress was designed by the local designer Huishan Zhang for Chris Lee, the renowned pop icon in China. The designer derived inspiration from the Fashion Zeitgesit and the Visual Discovery tool which allowed him to quickly explore fashion trends from close to 500000 images from runway shows spanning a decade.
