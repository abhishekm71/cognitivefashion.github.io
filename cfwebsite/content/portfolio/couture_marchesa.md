Marchesa first selected the five key human emotions they wanted their dress to convey.  Watson then ingested hundreds of images associates with Marchesa dress to understand the brand color palette. Watson then proceeded to search through more than 40,000 sources of fabric information and delivered 35 unique fabric recommendations to meet design requirements for weight, flexibility, and luminosity.  Embedded with LED lights, when the dress was debuted at the Met Gala, it changed colors based on the real-time emotions expressed on social media.
