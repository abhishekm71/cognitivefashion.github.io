Complete the Look for fashion recommends apparels which would go well with the apparel the user is interested in. Complete the Look works on existing product text attributes in catalog and can handle category, color, pattern, brand, style, price, occasion, size etc. while utilizing the style rules.

It leverages data from fashion social sites to curate the Style Rules thus recommending apparel categories and thereafter items from a catalog. It acts as a replacement for traditional recommender system based on purchase history and a precursor to a personalized fashion stylist.

Fashion evolves constantly and hence style rules is dynamically updated at regular intervals to include the current fashion apparels and trends.
