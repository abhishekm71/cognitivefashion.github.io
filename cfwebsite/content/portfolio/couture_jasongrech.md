IBM and Jason Grech launched a couture collection at MSFW 2016 developed using technology to analyze and predict fashion trends from runway images.

The Cognitive Collection is an exploration into unconventional design that takes a data-driven approach to design and decision making. We used publicly available fashion images along with visual recognition techniques to analyze and predict the color and print pattern trends in fashion which were used by the designer to choose the color palette for his designs. Grech also provided images of architectural shapes and structures he was inspired by, and we used deep image understanding to match architectural structural details to patterns and silhouettes in historic fashion runway images, providing the inspiration for new designs.

> The Cognitive Collection was shortlisted for 2017 [Innovation Lions](http://player.canneslions.com/index.html#/works?category=innovation&entry=831276&festival=LI) at Cannes. The Cannes Lions Awards celebrate the best creative work in the world. IBM and O&M also picked up a coveted silver medal at the [2017 APAC Effie Awards](http://www.apaceffie.com/apac-effie-press/2017/04/24/2017-apac-effie-awards-winners-announced#&panel1-1).
