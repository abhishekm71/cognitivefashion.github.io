Fashion is a multi-billion dollar industry with social and economic implications worldwide. Most fashion e-commerce portals are trying to be branded as not just an online warehouse, but more of a fashion destination. Luxury fashion houses want to create the similar in-store experience of visiting their high-end stores for their online channels. To realize this, we are building a suite of cognitive assets for the fashion retail industry around visual search, natural language search, recommendation, and trends. Our research is focussed on image understanding, natural language understanding and automatic taxonomy curation mainly with deep learning based methods with a strong focus on the fashion domain.

Our suite of modern cognitive computing technologies leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, dialog, computer vision and natural language understanding to empower online fashion retailers. **IBM Research Cognitive Fashion** technologies can increase the stickiness of the portal and ensure that the customer can find the right product of choice without spending hours searching portals and leading to more conversion. This can be of transformative value to online retailers especially focusing on fashion apparel, jewelry, furniture etc.
