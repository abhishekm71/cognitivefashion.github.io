Fashion is a multi-billion dollar industry with social and economic implications worldwide. Most fashion e-commerce portals are trying to be branded as not just an online warehouse, but more of a fashion destination. Luxury fashion houses want to create the similar in-store experience of visiting their high-end stores for their online channels. 

To realize this, we are building a suite of cognitive assets for the fashion retail industry around visual search, natural language search, recommendation, and trends. Our research is focussed on image understanding, natural language understanding and automatic taxonomy curation mainly with deep learning based methods with a strong focus on the fashion domain.
